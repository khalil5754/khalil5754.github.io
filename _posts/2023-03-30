# Using Golang (Go) With Databases
  While Python has been the dominant language in the data science community for many years, Go (also known as Golang) is emerging as a powerful and versatile language for data scientists.

Go is a statically typed, compiled language that was developed by Google in 2009. It is known for its simplicity, concurrency, and performance, making it well-suited for building scalable and efficient systems. While Go is not as popular in the data science community as Python, it has several advantages that make it a useful tool for data scientists.

In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of using Go for data science, including its performance, concurrency, and simplicity. We will also look at some of the popular Go libraries and tools for data science, such as Gorgonia, Gonum, and Gota, and how they can be used to build data pipelines and perform machine learning tasks.

By the end of this blog post, you will have a better understanding of why Go is a valuable language for data scientists, and how it can be used to tackle real-world data science problems.

First, the basics. Let's write a very simple function just to show you what Go syntax looks like.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var number int = 299
	fmt.Println(number)
}

```
# Explicit Vs. Implicit
