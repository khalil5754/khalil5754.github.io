###### Machine Learning & Robotic Process Automation (RPA): What's The Difference and Can I Use Them Together?

This is an excellent question and one which adds to the already confusing enough barrier to entry for aspiring data scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is simply the automation of any number of business processes accomplished using scripting, recording, some level of machine learning models, and human involvement.
Businesses benefit from RPA RPA is already in wide use across practically every industry but will likely continue to grow as acceptance of automation and pseudo-AI becomes more common.

#### Pseudo-AI? 

I like to think of RPA as a dumbed-down AI which has a different mandate.
