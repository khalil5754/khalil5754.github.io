# More Data Structures in Python (Binary Search, Linked Lists, and Sliding Windows)

Now I've had a lot more time to play around in Python and I'm back! I think I've grown a lot as a programmer since I started my Leetcode journey.
Many seem to consider Leetcode a waste of time but it really has altered how I think on a day-to-day at work. Things like edge-cases more frequently
cross my mind, along with actually thinking about the most _efficient_ solution, not just the first one that works.

In today's blog I want to explore some of the problems which I've found most applicable to my daily programming work. I don't really use linked lists,
but I thought I'd throw them in here because what I learned in the process of solving linked list problems was really interesting, and I likely won't
get a chance to use that knowledge anytime soon.
