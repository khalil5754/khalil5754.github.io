_Welcome_...
## If you're reading this it means I reached another human!
###### (at least, hopefully you're a human) 
## Let me introduce myself!

#### I'm a programming nerd who _loves_ learning new things. As I was working on my paper last summer I took a step back and thought: I've come a long way throughout my research on the road to publication, so why not create a page to keep track of all the "invisible learning" that's happened behind the scenes? In the process I get to create an aggregation of programming material and I can reinforce what I've learned by writing short and sweet Python/SQL tutorials too. Told you, I'm a nerd. I've decided to embrace it and it was the best decision I ever made.
