_Welcome_...
## If you're reading this it means I reached another human!
###### (at least, hopefully you're a human) 
## Let me introduce myself:

#### I'm a programming and data nerd who _loves_ learning new ways to work with data! As I was working on my paper last summer I took a step back and thought: I've come a long way throughout my research on the road to publication, so why not create a page to keep track of all the "invisible learning" that's happened behind the scenes? In the process I get to do what I love: programming and working with data while hopefully teaching others. Told you, I am a nerd.
