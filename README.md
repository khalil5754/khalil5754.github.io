Hello! I like to think of this as one big project - an aggregate of all the time and work I've put in learning data science and research skills over the last two years. My favourite languages are Python and SQL, but I also love creating visualizations and deriving useful insights from Tableau. Over the summer, I wrote a paper for publication in a journal, and that process taught me research skills that I don't believe I could have picked up anywhere else. I seek growth like a moth to a flame, and I love learning new things - some of which I'll show off throughout this project! I'll likely add more difficulty as time goes on and I learn more, and of course I'll be writing a metric ton of code for this project because at the end of the day, that's where my heart lies. Thanks for checking this out!
