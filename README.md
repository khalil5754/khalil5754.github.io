Hello! I like to think of this as less of a blog, and more an aggregate of all the time and work I've put in over the past two years. My favourite languages are Python and SQL, and I love creating visualizations and deriving useful insights from Tableau. I wrote a paper for publication over the summer which taught me research skills that I don't believe I could have picked up anywhere else. I seek growth like a moth to a flame, and I love learning new things - which I'll show off in this project! I'll likely add more stats and math as time goes on and I learn more, and of course a metric ton of code because at the end of the day, that's where my heart lies. Thanks!
