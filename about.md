### Who I Am

Hello! I'm Khalil, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and Data Science Enthusiast. I like to think of this as one big project - an aggregate of all the time and work I've put in learning data science and research skills over the last two years. I'm currently finishing my master's degree in Data Science and Analytics, and I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance. My favourite languages are Python and SQL, but I also love creating visualizations and deriving useful insights from Tableau. Over the summer, I wrote a paper that was accepted for publication in a journal, and that process taught me research skills that I don't believe I could have picked up anywhere else. I seek growth like a moth to a flame, and I love learning new things - some of which I'll show off throughout this project!

I'll likely add progressively more in-depth posts as time goes on and I learn more, and of course I'll be writing a metric ton of code for this project because at the end of the day, that's what I love the most. Thanks for checking this out!
